# Zakernel
This is a custom kernel configuration file designed for the Ideapad 3 15" laptop, **tailored specifically for use with Gentoo Kernel Sources**. The configuration has been optimized to minimize compile time, given the hardware limitations of the device, by removing unnecessary options. While not entirely minimalistic, it provides adequate functionality for the intended purpose.

It is intended to serve as a baseline for users of Ideapad laptops who wish to utilize Gentoo but are not yet prepared to undertake kernel configuration on their own. Suggestions for further improvements are welcome, as the aim is to enhance the configuration file to benefit the wider community of Ideapad users.
